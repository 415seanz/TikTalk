# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my chat application similar in nature to Slack. Users will pick a username to begin that will be stored locally. They can then create and use channels to facilitate discussion with others. New comments are broadcast to all users in real time with SocketIO. Users can also upvote comments they agree with. Upvote totals are again broadcast in real time via SocketIO.
